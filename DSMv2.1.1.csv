The sequence of the 146 nt deleted in this transcript corresponds in the rat GAMT gene to that of exon 2 (Ogawa and Fujioka 1988). Exon skipping can be caused by mutations of the 3' splice site of the preceding intron or of the 5' splice site of the following intron or a nonsense mutation within the exon (Cooper et al. 1995).

To evaluate this hypothesis, we first transfected LDLR minigenes into SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and found that the rs688T allele reduces exon 12 inclusion in this neural model. We then evaluated the association of rs688 allele with exon 12 splicing efficiency in vivo by quantifying LDLR splicing in human anterior cingulate tissue obtained at autopsy; the rs688T allele is associated with decreased LDLR exon 12 splicing efficiency in aged males, but not females. Lastly, we evaluated whether rs688 associates with AD by genotyping DNA from 1457 men and 2055 women drawn from three case-control series. The rs688T/T genotype was associated with increased AD odds in males [recessive model, odds ratio (OR) of 1.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.13-1.97, uncorrected P = 0.005], but not in females.",tmVar,0.059960444,0.007,0.004,0.11192,0.132,0.698281209,0.024953,0.007,0.025,0.181,-1.482,-0.976,-1.187,-6.69,0,9.45E-05,-1.223,68

We therefore used the ESEfinder (Exonic Splicing Enhancer) program (http://exon.cshl.org/ESE; Cartegni et al., 2003) to predict the potential effect of c.852CT variation on splicing activity. It was shown that this polymorphism is located in one of the binding motifs of splicing factor 2 (SF2/ASF) (CGCCCGA), and SF2/ASF is an important member of serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein family that plays a key role in pre-RNA splicing (Krainer et al., 1991; Graveley, 2000; Cartegni et al., 2002; Sanford et al., 2005). According to the analysis with ESEfinder, allele T apparently may decrease the activity of pre-RNA splicing compared to allele C, hence reduce the expression of GRTH gene. As a binding protein and a component of mRNP, GRTH could play an important role in the translation of some crucial genes at a specific stage during spermatogenesis and influence the expression of sets of genes determining the progression of spermatogenesis (Tsai-Morris et al., 2004). Therefore the decreased expression of GRTH gene may affect the expression of important genes required in spermatogenesis leading even to spermatogenesis failure. This may explain why the allele T of c.852CT polymorphism of GRTH gene increases the risk of impaired spermatogenesis.

These changes lie 23 nucleotides distal to the start of exon 11 and significantly reduce the levels of FL and D(11q) in favour of increased levels of D(11) isoform. This suggests that sequence changes at this site alter the splicing of exon 11, through reduced recognition of the intron 10 acceptor site, resulting in its exclusion from the final mRNA. This finding points towards an important sequence element, such as an exonic splicing enhancer, located around codon 231. Substitutions at codon 231 caused skipping of exon 11 with a marked increase in amounts of the D(11) isoform. Overexpression of this isoform in mouse epithelial mammary cells has been shown to cause atypical duct hyperplasia [17].

Abnormal splicing is incomplete, so the mutant allele produces some normally-spliced transcripts. Nevertheless, the synthesis of progerin is sufficient to cause misshapen nuclei in cultured cells and severe disease phenotypes in affected patients. Here we present two patients with extraordinarily severe forms of progeria caused by unusual mutations in LMNA. One had a splice site mutation (c.1968+1G>A; or IVS11+1G>A), and the other had a novel synonymous coding region mutation (c.1821G>A/p.V607V). Both mutations caused very frequent use of the same exon 11 splice donor site that is activated in typical HGPS patients. As a consequence, the ratios of progerin mRNA and protein to wild-type were higher than in typical HGPS patients. Fibroblasts from both patients exhibited nuclear shape abnormalities typical of HGPS, and cells treated with a protein farnesyltransferase inhibitor exhibited fewer misshapen nuclei.",tmVar,0.564686433,0.812,0.47,0.80422,11.04,0.941001248,0.074429,0.992,1,0.993,0.557,1.04,0.93,2.57,1,0.001548841,2.611,123

Only a single base change was identified by genomic DNA sequence analysis of the CYP 27 gene in the patient: T replaced G at the third position of codon 112, 13 bp upstream from the 3'terminus of exon 2. Transfection of constructed minigenes, with or without the mutation, confirmed that this silent mutation resulted in alternative pre-mRNA splicing by activating a cryptic 5' splice site around the mutant codon. The mutation was also identified in two patients from another CTX family, with a compound heterozygous pattern of A for G substitution at codon 372, a mutation reported previously by our group. The results elucidate a novel molecular basis for the CTX and suggest the significance of a silent nucleotide substitution with regard to pre-RNA splicing.","tmVar,Manual Read",0.580115226,0.693,0.77,0.35868,6.913,0.632906966,0.043341,0.361,0.729,0.939,-0.362,-0.441,-0.264,-0.622,0,0.001142311,0.506,12

By western-blot analysis, G beta3-s appears to be predominantly expressed in cells from individuals carrying the T allele.

Although this is a silent polymorphism, an effect of synonymous codon usage on gene expression has been supported by the detection of epistatic interactions between nucleotides that are important in maintaining pre-mRNA/RNA secondary structures (41). The presence of the rare allele of SNP S237S might modify the mRNA folding, stability and translation of EHMT2 protein and consequently lead to altered protein activity.

Although this variant results in a silent change, its position in the penultimate base of exon 3 raised the possibility that it might affect splicing. To investigate this, we suppressed nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) with emetine in cell lines from two unrelated 430T heterozygous patients and sequenced MGC1203. Although we did not detect aberrant splicing at the 3 0 junction of exon 3, we found that, in addition to all normal splice isoforms of MGC1203, 10% of the sequenced products contained a 5-bp deletion in the acceptor site at the 5 0 junction of the same exon. This deletion was generated by the inappropriate utilization of a cryptic splice acceptor site (Fig. 2c) and resulted in a PTC. Analysis with ESEfinder21 predicted that the 430T variant might improve an exonic splice enhancer (ESE) motif recognized by the SR protein SC35 (for splicing component of 35 kDa)22 (Fig. 2c).",tmVar,0.100802545,0.119,0.006,0.04086,14.37,0.756790957,0.010559,0.836,0.744,0.684,-1.209,-1.923,-0.78,-9.46,0,0.000970966,-0.493,2

Allele age of p.R778L was determined by the smallest homozygosity region between D13S301 and D13S270. We identified 42 different mutations with 17 being novel. p.R778L (17.3%) was the most prevalent. Exons 2, 8, 12, 13, and 16 harbored 70% mutations. Thirty-two haplotypes were associated with WD chromosomes. The estimated prevalence rate was 1 in 5,400. Three out of 660 normal subjects had p.L770L/p.R778L. In the remaining 657 individuals, neither p.L770L nor p.R778L was found.

Thus the G-allele seems to inactivate a potential pseudo-splice site that might lead to a better splicing of the normal transcript.",tmVar,0.02908883,0.021,0.112,0.03619,5.973,0.593564887,0.010989,0.986,0.011,0.001,-0.14,0.453,0.171,1.42,0,0.002093628,n/a,34

Her parents were carriers of this silent variant/mutation, confirming homozygosity in the affected child. The biochemically unaffected sibling (ie, normal -AASA levels) was heterozygous for the mutation like her parents. The mutation was not detected in 210 control chromosomes. RNA isolated from the blood of the patient, her parents, and control subjects followed by reverse transcriptase PCR and direct sequencing of the complementary DNA demonstrated that only the authentic site appears to be used in the control. However, analysis of the RNA from our patient, who is homozygous for the c.750G A variant, demonstrated that the cryptic site is preferentially used over this authentic site. In contrast, RNA isolated from blood of the parents, who are heterozygous for the mutation, showed only the presence of properly spliced mRNA.

To address whether this substitution is the main determinant for exon skipping, PAH minigenes with or without the substitution were constructed and transfected to a human hepatoma cell line. Analysis of the transcription products by S1 nuclease mapping clearly indicated that such exon 11 skipping was directly associated with the c.1197A/T substitution. Thus, this study demonstrates that the c.1197A/T substitution in the PAH gene is not just a neutral polymorphism but a mutation that induces post-transcriptional skipping of exon 11 leading to a PKU phenotype.","tmVar,Manual Read",0.88146478,0.93,0.783,0.90425,14.73,0.806533276,0.40548,0.877,0.999,0.999,-0.47,0.231,0.422,2.51,0,0.003445243,-0.919,3

GGG triplets are part of the consensus motif bound by splicing-inhibitory hnRNPH proteins and we observed a dramatic increase in hnRNPH binding to c.30C>G PAH RNA. We conclude that c.30C>G creates a hnRNPH-binding ESS, which can disrupt mRNA splicing. A disease-causing mutation in HEXB, which has previously been associated with exon skipping in patients also creates a GGG triplet. We show that the mutant HEXB motif causes exon skipping of a reporter minigene and that this is also influenced by a flanking GGG triplet. We suggest that aberrant splicing caused by creation/abolishment of GGG triplets located together with a preexisting flanking GGG triplet, may be an underreported cause of human disease.","tmVar,Manual Read",0.136995227,0.287,0.011,0.11487,5.83,0.361015416,0.039533,0.001,0.001,0,-0.18,0.867,0.507,2.18,0,0.00110084,n/a,31

The aims of this study were to establish to what extent the cryptic splice site is selected ahead of the normal splice site and to determine if the aberrant transcript is degraded by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes were established from one heterozygous patient, and treatment of these cells with cycloheximide increased the amount of aberrant transcript, indicating that the aberrant transcripts are degraded by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Cloning of reverse transcriptase-PCR products from one of the heterozygous patients and introduction of the R385R mutation into a minigene reporter construct revealed an almost exclusive use of the cryptic splice site in the mutated allele.

Minigene analysis revealed that both the wild-type and mutant sequences expressed a full-length transcript and a short transcript lacking exon 9. Quantitation of the relative amount of the two transcripts indicated that the fraction of the full-length transcript derived from c.1275A>G is much lower than that derived from the wild-type (51.9% vs 77.4%). Extinction of two splicing factors (SF2/ASF and SC35) by RNA interference also affected c.1275A>G more seriously than the wild-type in terms of exon 9 skipping.

A computer search using an ESE finder showed that an exonic splicing enhancer sequence, SF2/ASF, was located in CTGA(951)CGC. We hypothesized that the exonic splicing enhancer is necessary for accurate splicing since the first nucleotide of exon 10 is C, which weakens the splice acceptor site of intron 9. We made a mini gene construct including exon 9-truncated intron 9-exon 10-truncated intron 10-exon 11 for a splicing experiment. We also made three mutant constructs which alter the SF2/ASF site (947C>T, 951C>T, 952G>A). An min-gene splicing experiment clearly showed that exon 10 skipping was induced in all three mutant constructs.

However, cDNA analysis indicated that, more importantly, the mutation results in the aberrant splicing within exon 8. The change creates a polypyrimidine tract, which typically precedes a 30 splice site, and induces the usage of a new intronic 30 splice site using a nearby downstream AG. The normal 30 splice site has a MaxENT score of 7.84, while the new 30 splice site has a score of 8.54 when not mutated and a MaxENT score of 10.42 when mutated.

The mother of Pt.1 was found to be heterozygous for this substitution. Single strand conformational polymorphism analysis of exon 5 from 150 normal chromosomes ruled out the possibility that this nucleotide substitution may represent a polymorphism. Interestingly, this mutation occurs in a putative exonic splicing enhancer, a cis-element that promotes inclusion of specific exons (20) through binding by the serineyarginine-rich splicing factors (21). Based on the observation made on other genes (i.e., SMN and BRCA1 genes), where the occurrence of nonsense, missense, or silent mutations prevent correct splicing resulting in exon skipping (20, 22C24), we speculated that skipping of exon 5 in Pt.1 may arise from disruption of a putative SF2yASF binding motif. By applying a nucleotide frequency matrix calculation (20, 25,26), we found that the A455T mutation reduces the score for the SF2yASF motif in exon 5 from a highly significant to an essentially null value (Fig. 4).","tmVar,Manual Read",0.470448663,0.645,0.113,0.1238,6.789,0.285141296,0.012246,0.022,0.14,0.233,0.346,-0.034,0.12,0.931,0,0.002241792,2.257,5
